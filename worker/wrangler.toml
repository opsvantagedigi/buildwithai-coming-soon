# Worker wrangler configuration intentionally removed.

# This file previously contained Wrangler configuration for Cloudflare
# deployments. To prepare this repository for a fresh Worker deployment,
# the original contents have been cleared.

# If/when you're ready to reintroduce Cloudflare Wrangler config, recreate
# `worker/wrangler.toml` with required entries (name, account_id, bindings).
